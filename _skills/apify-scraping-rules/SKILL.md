  abstract: Defines the standard operating procedures for web scraping and data extraction in the Antigravity ecosystem using Apify. Mandates the use of pre-built Apify Store Actors (e.g., Google Maps Email Extractor, Instagram Profile Scraper) to bypass anti-bot systems automatically. When custom scraping is required, defines the rules for Actor development using CheerioCrawler vs PlaywrightCrawler, proxy usage, and Apify SDK storage mechanisms.

# Apify Scraping Rules (AI Best Practices)

Web scraping is a core component of many Antigravity projects (sales automation, lead generation, competitor research, etc.). Because modern websites aggressively block automated traffic, raw Python/Node scraping scripts (e.g., raw BeautifulSoup or Selenium) are heavily discouraged. Always use Apify.

## 1. Actor Discovery & Selection (Critical)

**Rule: DO NOT reinvent the wheel.** The Apify Store contains over 4,500 production-ready scraping tools (Actors) that handle proxies, CAPTCHAs, and browser fingerprinting out of the box.

- **Action:** When tasked with extracting data from a major platform, ALWAYS search the Apify Store first.
- **Examples:**
  - **Google Maps:** Use `Google Maps Email Extractor` (`WnMxbsRLNbPeYL6ge`) or `Google Maps Scraper` (`Compass`).
  - **Instagram:** Use `Instagram Profile Scraper` (`dSCLg0C3YEZ83HzYX`) or `Instagram Scraper` (`apify/instagram-scraper`).
  - **LinkedIn:** Search for specialized LinkedIn lead generation actors.
- **Integration:** Call these actors via the Apify API (`apify-client` in Python) using the `APIFY_API_TOKEN` stored in `master.env`.

## 2. API & SDK Integration

When calling existing Actors from Python code:
- **Rule:** Use the official `apify-client` library.
- **Pattern:** Always run the actor, wait for it to finish, and stream the results from the default dataset.
  ```python
  from apify_client import ApifyClient
  client = ApifyClient(os.getenv("APIFY_API_TOKEN"))
  
  # Start the actor and wait for it to finish
  run = client.actor("actor_id").call(run_input={"search": "query"})
  
  # Fetch results
  for item in client.dataset(run["defaultDatasetId"]).iterate_items():
      print(item)
  ```

## 3. Custom Actor Development (If Store Actor Doesn't Exist)

If you must build a custom scraper because the target is a niche website, build it as an Apify Actor using Crawlee (Node.js/TypeScript) or the Apify Python SDK.

- **Crawlee Selection:** 
  - ALWAYS default to `CheerioCrawler` (or `BeautifulSoup` in Python) for static HTML pages. It is 10x faster and cheaper.
  - ONLY use `PlaywrightCrawler` if the website heavily relies on Client-Side Rendering (React/Vue) or requires complex interactions (login, clicking).
- **Anti-Blocking:** Always enable Apify Proxy (`proxyConfiguration`). Never scrape from the raw server IP.
- **Data Storage:** Do not save data to local files (`.csv` or `.json` on disk). Use Apify's `Dataset` for tabular data (pushData) and `KeyValueStore` for files/images.
- **Logging:** Use the official logger (e.g., `import { log } from 'apify';`) to ensure sensitive data is censored and logs are formatted correctly in the Apify Console.

## 4. Local Testing & Deployment

- **Local Run:** Before deploying, always test the actor locally using `apify run`. Ensure the input schema (`INPUT_SCHEMA.json`) works correctly.
- **Deployment:** Use `apify push` to deploy the actor to the cloud.

## 5. Cost Estimation & Rate Limiting

- **Rule:** Be mindful of Compute Units (CUs). Playwright is much more expensive than Cheerio. When running large loops over Apify API, ensure you don't exhaust the monthly credit limit.
- **Batching:** Pass multiple URLs or search terms in a single Actor run rather than triggering the Actor 100 separate times via the API. Each run has a boot-up cost.
